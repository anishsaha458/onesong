# requirements.txt — OneSong API v4.6
#
# Every package here has a pre-built binary wheel for Python 3.11 (cp311)
# on Linux x86_64. None require Rust, Cargo, or C compilation.
#
# pydantic-core is the package that was failing — it's written in Rust and
# has no wheel for Python 3.14 yet, so pip tried to compile from source
# and hit Render's read-only /usr/local/cargo filesystem.
# Pinned to 2.18.2 which has a confirmed cp311 manylinux wheel on PyPI.
#
# essentia is intentionally absent — installed separately in render.yaml
# buildCommand with || true so a missing wheel doesn't abort the build.
